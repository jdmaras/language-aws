# IB Language Translator

## Description
I wanted to make a translator application for a relatives made-up language they used when were kids. The idea is that you would replace the first vowel in every word in a sentence with "ib". They originally used it to confuse their mom and eventually got very fast with forming sentences and wanted to give other relatives a chance to play along. 

This was also a chance for me to create an application and learn how to host it using AWS.

## Technology Used
 - React.js
 - AWS Amplify
 - AWS Route 53
